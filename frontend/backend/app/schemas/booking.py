"""
Booking Schemas

Purpose
-------
Resource booking contracts: create, cancel, reschedule, calendar view.

Responsibilities
-----------------
- Validate request payloads (Create/Update/Filter) coming from routers.
- Shape response payloads (Response/List) returned to routers.
- Own field-level VALIDATION rules only (required fields, formats, lengths).
- Never contain business RULES (those belong in the Service layer).

Interacts With
--------------
- api/v1/booking.py -> routers import these schemas as request/response models.
- services/*.py -> services receive/return these schema objects (not raw ORM models).

NOTE: This file is a structural skeleton only. Method/function bodies are
intentionally left as `pass` (no business logic / SQL / validation code),
per generation scope. Docstrings describe what each piece IS responsible
for once implemented.
